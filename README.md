# React Components Challange - Rick And Morty

![rick and morty](https://github.com/David-L-R/react-challenge-rick-and-morty/assets/31222514/60068812-a29d-4714-bcc7-85af0acbab6a)

## How To Start

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new folder on your computer
3. `git init`
4. Connect to the repository you just forked (instructions should be inside the repository)
5. `git pull origin main`
6. `npm i`
7. `npn run start`

## Resuable Components

The main goal of this exercise is to break down the current component into smaller, reusable parts. Thing about each piece of the puzzle and create a component out of it.

For example, break the following

```js
<nav>
   <ul>
     <li>Home</li>
     <li>Setting</li>
     <li>Profile</li>
   </ul>
</nav>
<div className="popup">
   <h1>Good morning, {userName}</h1>
   <p>some text...</p>
<div>
```

into two components:

```js
<Nav />
<Popup />
```

## Prop Drilling

In order to pass the information from the main component (that had all the information) into the smaller components we've built, we should pass the props:

```js
< Nav />
<Popup userName={userName} />
```

Then, `<Popup />` can use these props:

```js
const Popup = ({ userName }) => {
  return (
    <div className='popup'>
      <h1>Good morning, {userName}</h1>
      <p>some text...</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## State

## Challenge 1: Use Dynamic List

Use the characters list to create a unique card for each character. Make sure that there are maximum 3 cards per row. This should be responsive, on mobile, there should be only one card per row.

## Challenge 2: Divide Into Components

The App.js components is hard to read, too many things in it. Let's break it down to smaller pieces. Here, there is no "correct answer" here. Different developers might break it down differently. To practice in the best way, I suggest to try and break it down to really small pieces.

## Challenge 3.1: Search By Name üå∂Ô∏è

Add search functionality that goes over the names of the characters, and matches the search string to the name. The search string should find names that the string is included in.

For example, typing `rick` should find the characters `Rick Sanchez` and `Pickle Rick`. The case should not matter -upper case and lower case should give the same result. So `rick` and `RiCk` and `RICk` should find the same.

## Challenge 3.2: Search By Any Field üå∂Ô∏è

Searching would match the string not only to the names of the characters but also to the superpowers and weaknesses. So searching for `emo` will find:

- Rick Sanchez because he has the weakness `Emotional detachment`
- Beth Smith because she has the superpower `Emotional strength`

## Challenge 4: Remove üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

Pressing on the `remove` button should delete the character from the list, and the card should not be shown. Restarting the page should bring the character back (because we are not using a database yet).

## Challenge 5: Favorites üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

Pressing on the Heart (inside the image), should change the empty the heart to a full one, and should present the character first. All characters that are favroites should be presented first.

## Challenge 6: Search By Type üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

Add a new input, which will be a dropdown of: `name`, `superpower`, `weakness` and `select...`. Choosing `name`, `superpower` or `weakness` should return the characters that match the string in the search box.

So `rick` will not bring `Rick Sanchez` if `superpower` was selected, because Rick is the name. Moreover, `select...` should still search all proporties (like before).

## Challenge 7: Edit üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

Okay, are you ready for beast mode?

1. Create a new button for `edit`
2. Pressing on it should change the card into inputs
3. There should be inputs of superpowers and weaknesses, and for each an input for the emoji
4. saving the form should change the details of that character
